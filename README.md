How to use the system
===========
As a student you can sign up and/or log in and if you already have an application it will appear for you to update, otherwise you will be taken to create an application. 

As a tutor manager you can view the applications and use the select boxes on an application to set the state of the allocation between the student and the course. They can also set the payrate. They can look at the course and see the allocations and then propose the course to the course controller. After the course co-ordinator has Accepted/Rejected the applications proposed for their course, the tutor manager can then finalise the course and then export the finalised tutors. 
The course co-ordinator will have tutors proposed to them and then can see the applications and accept or reject their tutoring.

From the menu bar the tutor manager can redirect to some system configuration pages. These pages allow the tutor manager to change the systems current year and term (which in turn stops old applications showing up in new terms), the deadline for applications and import new course among others.
